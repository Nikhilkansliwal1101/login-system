# login-system

This project is a  ready to use login system for a php project.
This set session variable “userid” and “usermail” after successful login in the system. That can be used for managing other pages of the php project accordingly.
In this project I have used :
1.	Php as backend.
2.	Html, javascipt and bootstracp for css.
3.	Python for sending mail

1.	Login.php
  a.	User can login to system using email and password.
  b.	User can reset password using email.
2.	Signin.php
  a.	User can signup to the system after verify the email and filling required info.
3.	Profile.php
  a.	User can see his user information.
  b.	User can update his user information.
